# Class 7 Reading Notes

## Python Scope

### Local scope 
- is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function.

### Enclosing scope - 
is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function.

### Global scope 
- is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module.

### Built-in scope 
- is a special Python scope thatâ€™s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python.
