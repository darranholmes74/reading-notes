## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

TDD stands for Test-Driven Development, and it is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests for code before writing the actual code. TDD is often used in Agile development methodologies and has become increasingly popular in recent years.


## If name equals main

If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

## Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
