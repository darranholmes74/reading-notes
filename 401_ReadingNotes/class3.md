## Read & Write Files in Python

When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:

Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
File Name: the actual name of the file
Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

## Exceptions in Python

You can use the 

```file = open("text_file.txt")```
and 
```file = close()```
