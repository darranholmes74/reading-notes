# Class 14 Reading Assignment

1. 

Matplotlib:  Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library. It offers a low-level interface, allowing users to have fine-grained control over their plots.

Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.

Bokeh: Bokeh is a library for creating interactive visualizations and interactive data applications. It focuses on providing interactive and browser-based plots, enabling users to create rich, interactive visualizations with JavaScript-based interactions. 

2. 
Relational plots:

```
sns.relplot()
```
Relational plots are used to visualize the relationship between two or more variables.

Categorical Plots:

```
sns.catplot(), sns.boxplot(), sns.barplot()
```

Categorical plots are used to visualize the distribution or relationship between categorical variables.

Distribution Plots:

```
sns.histplot(), sns.kdeplot(), sns.ecdfplot()
```

Distribution plots are used to visualize the distribution of a single variable or the relationship between multiple variables.

3. Some key sections and elements featured in the Seaborn Cheat Sheet that can be helpful are:

Plotting Functions: The cheat sheet showcases the main plotting functions available in Seaborn, such as relplot(), catplot(), histplot(), and more. It gives a brief description of each function and its purpose.

Styling Options: Seaborn offers several styling options to customize the appearance of plots. The cheat sheet highlights essential parameters for controlling colors, markers, line styles, and more. This allows developers to create visually appealing and informative visualizations.

Categorical Plotting: Categorical plots are widely used, and the cheat sheet provides an overview of functions like barplot(), boxplot(), swarmplot(), and others. It explains how to encode different variables, such as hue, order, and estimator, to create informative categorical plots.

Statistical Estimation: Seaborn integrates statistical estimation functions with plotting. The cheat sheet covers functions like lmplot(), regplot(), and residplot(), which can be used to visualize linear regression models and residuals.

Matrix Plots: Seaborn includes functions for matrix plots, such as heatmap() and clustermap(), which are useful for exploring correlations and patterns in large datasets. The cheat sheet provides an overview of these functions and their customization options.
