1. JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. Jupyter Lab builds upon the foundation of Jupyter Notebook and extends it with a more versatile and feature-rich environment.

2. NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides powerful tools and functionalities for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. 

3. NumPy arrays, or ndarrays, are the fundamental data structure provided by the NumPy library

Examples:

```
import numpy as np

arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

zeros = np.zeros((3, 4))

ones = np.ones((2, 3))

random = np.random.rand(4, 4)
```
