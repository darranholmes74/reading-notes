1. Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types.

An example of a common dunder method would be:

```__str__```


2. The ethical issue was with not crediting people and still code from other devs. The way to avoid this in the future is to always credit people if you use their work.


3. The statistics module offers functions to calculate basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more.

Here is an example code of this:

```
import statistics

data = [10, 15, 12, 17, 14, 11, 16]
mean_value = statistics.mean(data)

print("Mean:", mean_value)

```
