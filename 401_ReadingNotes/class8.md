## List Comprehensions

1. List comprehension differs from using a for loop to create a list in that it combines the iteration and transformation steps into a single line of code. It is a more concise and readable way to create a new list from an existing one.

2. In Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function as input, adds some functionality to it, and returns the modified function. A decorator allows you to modify the behavior of a function without changing its source code. Decorators are used to wrap or modify functions or classes in Python. They are often used to add new functionality to existing functions or classes, such as adding logging or timing to a function. They can also be used to create new functions or classes that have specific behaviors or properties.

3. Decorators are functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions or classes. Decorators work by defining a function that takes another function as input, modifies it, and returns it. 

Some common use cases for decorators in Python include:

- Adding logging or debugging information to a function

- Measuring the execution time of a function

- Checking the arguments or return values of a function

@my_decorator syntax is used to apply the decorator to the say_hello function.
