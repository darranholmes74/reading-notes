# 401 Prework

## The Command Line

Most of this for me was a good review. We have been using the command line in 102 - 301 so much now if feels like second nature. I did however learn a few new things while reading the articles. The one that stood out to me the most was the 'man' command. I never knew you could look up what commands do and mean straight from the terminal. I'm also very greatful for the cheat sheet that is offered.

# SQL

## Learn SQL

My understanding of SQL is way deeper now that I did the Learn SQL exercises. I like the structure of SQL a little more than noSQL in that it has a set stucture to follow. It makes it easier to select a column of data and update it much easier. Learning the different way to filter and show only the data you want is also very useful.
