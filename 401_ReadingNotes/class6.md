# Class 6 Reading Assignment 

1. The use for the random module is to generate random numbers in different ways.

some examples would be:

random(), randint(a, b), choice(seq), shuffle(seq), and more.

2. Risk analysis in software development is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential risks and uncertainties that can affect the success of a software project.

The key steps are:

Search the risk, analyzing the impact of each individual risk, and measures for the risk identified.

3. Test coverage is the perecentage of code that has been covered by tests. This is important because it allows devs to insure their code is working correctly as they go.

4. Big O is the Time and space complexity of a giving algorithm. 

When you have a bag of groceries and you want to count how many items are in it, you typically go through the bag item by item and increment a counter. The time it takes to count the items increases linearly with the number of items in the bag. If you have n items in the bag, you need to perform n operations (i.e., look at each item) to determine the count.

For instance, if you have a bag with 10 items, it will take you more time to count than if you have a bag with 5 items. Similarly, if you have a bag with 100 items, it will take more time than if you have a bag with 50 items. The time it takes to count the items scales linearly with the number of items, which is an example of O(n) time complexity.
