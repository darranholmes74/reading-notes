# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem, it is important to consider the efficiency and performance characteristics of the data structure. Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of their efficiency and performance

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Recursive functions should have a base case that specifies when the recursion should stop. Make sure that your base case is correctly defined and that it covers all possible scenarios.
