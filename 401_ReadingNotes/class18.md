# Class 18 Reading Assignment

1. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that operates by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

2. The key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption lie in the way encryption and decryption keys are used and shared: key generation, key distribution, encryption and decryption, security and scalability.

3. 
TRNG generates numbers from a source of randomness that is inherently unpredictable and based on physical processes.

- use cases:
symmetric encryption, simulations and protocols

PRNG generates numbers using deterministic algorithms and an initial seed value.

- use cases:
randomness, determinism, periodicity

4. 

Encryption is like putting your message inside the locked box. You take your original message and transform it using a specific algorithm and a secret key. The encrypted message is the result of this process. The ciphertext appears random and readable to anyone who doesn't have the key.

Decryption is like giving the locked box to Alice along with the key. When Alice receives the locked box, she can use the key to unlock it and retrieve the original message. Decryption is the process of transforming the ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same algorithm and key that were used for encryption.
