After reading The code I'm still ashamed of I can understand the authors dilemma complelity. As a new developer getting your first job I can understand the feeling of just wanting to go with the flow and do want your told. After getting more experience I think he made the right decision to leave. Now regarding self driving cars, I am in agreement with the people that say we have to high of a standard on the self driving cars to make a dicision about whos life to save when we wouldn't be able to make that decision ourselfs. I think the fact that self driving case will reduce accidents by 90% is worth it. To many people die each year from car accidents.
