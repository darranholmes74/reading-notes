## The code I'm still ashamed of and Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

After reading The code I'm still ashamed of I can understand the author's dilemma completely. As a new developer getting your first job I can understand the feeling of just wanting to go with the flow and do want you told. After getting more experience I think he made the right decision to leave. Now regarding self-driving cars, I agree with the people that say we have too high of a standard on self-driving cars to decide whose life to save when we wouldn't be able to make that decision ourselves. I think the fact that self-driving cars will reduce accidents by 90% is worth it. Too many people die each year from car accidents.
