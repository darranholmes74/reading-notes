## Pandas - Getting Started

The purpose of the Pandas library is to provide an easy-to-use, powerful data manipulation toolkit that enables users to work with structured data in a variety of formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL, and more. The library provides two main data structures: Series and DataFrame.

Some common operations that can be performed on data using Pandas include:

Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization and Data Analysis.

These operations contribute to data analysis and manipulation by enabling users to quickly and easily perform common data-related tasks, clean and transform data, visualize data, and draw insights from data.

## Real Python - Pandas Tutorials

1. Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It is like a column in a spreadsheet or a SQL table.

2. DataFrame: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

The main difference between Series and DataFrame is that Series is a one-dimensional data structure, whereas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure.
