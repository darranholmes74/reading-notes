A wireframe is the structure of a website before any special colors or features are added. The wireframe is used to make the website have good design and userability.

## HTML basics

#### What is HTML

Markup language the defines the structure of the content.

Main Elements

- The opening tag

- The closing tag

- The content

- The element - the opening and closing tag together are elements.

Attributes contain info about the element the you don't want to appear as content.

**Nesting** is when one element is inside another.

**Void Elements** like ```(</img>)``` have no content and have no closing tag.

HTML Structure Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Semantics

Semantics is the meaning of a piece of code.

## Things I want to know more about

I understand that HTML is used to make website, however, I'm curious if a coding language like Javascript could also be used to make a website as well, or is that strictly with HTML and CSS?
