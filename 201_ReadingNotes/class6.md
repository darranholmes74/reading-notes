## JS Object Basics

1. An object is like a container that can hold different types of information or data. Imagine a big box that can have many smaller boxes inside of it. Each of these smaller boxes can have a name, and inside of it can be something like a number, a word, or even another container. These smaller boxes inside the big box are called properties.

2. Object literals allow you to create objects quickly and easily, without the need for complex class definitions.

3. Objects are useful when you need to store data as key-value pairs, and arrays are useful when you need to store data in an ordered list.

4. If you want to access a property whose name is stored in a variable.

5. The "this" keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. "This" enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.



## Introduction to the Dom

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

2. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
