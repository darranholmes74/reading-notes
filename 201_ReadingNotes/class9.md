## Learn JS

1. An event is when code is applied whenever something starts like when you click on a button or a page refreshes.

2. 
+ The string 'click', indicates that we want to listen to the click event

+ a function to call when the event happens.

3. The event object is an object that is passed to an event handler when an event is triggered. It contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element that the event occurred on, and any event-specific data.

4. Event bubbling and event capturing are two ways in which events propagate through the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript.
