## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

It excels at taking a bunch of items that have different sizes and returning the best layout for those items.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

he main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.


3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Lack of semantic meaning: Flexbox is a layout method and does not provide any semantic meaning to the content it is used on. This can make it difficult for assistive technologies to understand the purpose of the content.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

With float you can't: Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

This connects with my long-term goals because it will make some aspects of working in CSS for sidebars much easier in the future. Rather than dealing with float and positioning.
