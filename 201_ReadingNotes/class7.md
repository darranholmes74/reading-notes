## Introducing Constructors

1. A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize an object when it is created. When you create an object using a constructor, you can define the properties and methods that should be included in every object created using that constructor.

2. In an object literal, the term "this" refers to the object that the literal is creating. In a constructor, the term "this" refers to the object that is being created by the constructor.

##  Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. I previously worked at a gun holster company where we manufactured and shipped out hosters. At the warehouse, we had plastic models or our "prototypes" of each gun in order to make the multiple hosters. Each holster would be different but followed the blueprint of the original prototype. Inheritance would be like if the company creates a new plastic model for a new gun using the blueprint of a previous plastic model. They would use the exact mold from the old model but just add to it.
