##Class 1 - Reading Assignment

Markdown for GitHub is a formating syntax that is exicilent to learn especially if you are just starting to learn code. Using markdown allows the user to change the format of a text with the use of one or more symbles.
If you wanted to make a text bold and italicized at the same time you can use symbles *** on both side of the word to do this, for example, '***lemon***'.
It only take a few symbels to make this change.
