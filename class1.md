# Class 1 - Reading Assignment

Markdown for GitHub is a formatting syntax that is excellent to learn especially if you are just starting to learn code. Using markdown allows the user to change the format of a text with the use of one or more symbols.
If you wanted to make a text bold and italicized at the same time you can use symbols *** on both sides of the word to do this, for example:
```
***lemon***
```
It only takes a few symbols to change the word lemon to ***lemon*** as shown above.

With more practice markdown on GitHub even be used to help create basic websites. In conclusion, I believe markdown will be a great skill to learn for quickly formating texts for stylized writing and creating websites in the future. It is simple to use and a nice starter language for beginners.

## Things I want to know more about

A question that I had while reading this material was, how often is markdown used outside of GitHub? I have heard a lot about HTML and CSS, but have never heard of markdown until this class. This surprises me becasue of how simple it is to use initially.
