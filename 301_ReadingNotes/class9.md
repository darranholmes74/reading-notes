## Functional Programming Concepts

1. Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. It returns the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects.

3. Pure functions always return the same output for the same input, which makes them easier to test, debug, and reason about.

4. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after itâ€™s created.

5.  A property of a programming language or program where a given expression can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the behavior of the program.
