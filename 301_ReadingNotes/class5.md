## React Docs - Thinking in React

1. The Single Responsibility Principle is a software design principle that states that a module or class should have only one reason to change. It component should have a single responsibility or task that it is responsible for, and it should not take on additional responsibilities that are not related to its primary purpose.

2. Building a "static" version of an application means creating a version of the application that doesn't rely on dynamic content or server-side rendering.

3.  You may need to add some additional functionality to make it fully functional.

4. 

* Does it change over time? 

* Can it be shared across multiple components or functions?

* Can it be reconstructed or derived from other sources?

5. Find out if it changes over time, can it be shared across mulitiple components, can it be reconstructed or derived from other sources.

## Higher-Order Functions

1. A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.

2. THe greaterThan function is comparing if 11 is greater than 10.

3. Both map() and reduce() are higher-order functions commonly used in functional programming languages to transform and manipulate arrays or lists of data.
