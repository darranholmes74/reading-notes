specified location in a file or directory that is with the root directory indicated by and (/) in the beginning.
A relative path is a specified location in the file/directory with the current location in the system.

#### More About Files

Use quotes to tell the terminal to view a file as a single command.
Use a backslash (\) to nullify the meaning of the next character.
