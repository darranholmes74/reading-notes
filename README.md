To me having a ***growth mindset*** means having the belief that with time your abilities/knowledge will continuously improve over time.

Ways to remind me to have a growth mindset.

1. Remember that failure is part of the process.

2. Take everything one step at a time.

3. If I get stuck, step away and return to it later with fresh eyes.
