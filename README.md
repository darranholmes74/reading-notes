Hi my name is Darran! You can find me on: [My github](https://darranholmes74.github.io/reading-notes)

To me having a growth mindset means to have the believe that with time your abilities will always improve overtime.

Ways to remind myself to have a growth mindset.

1. Remember that failure is part of the process.

2. Take everything one step at a time.

3. If I get stuck, step away and come back to it later with fresh eyes.
